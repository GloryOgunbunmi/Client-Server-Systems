# Client-Server-Systems

This is a TCP server which serves multiple clients simultaneously 
(i.e., the server starts a different thread to serve
each new client)

Each client should continuously send requests and receive replies from the server until a
request "END" which terminates the connection with the server

The client should print the arithmetic result from the server on the screen for user to
verify.
